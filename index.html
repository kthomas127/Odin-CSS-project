                "Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
                Our deepest fear in that we are powerful beyond measure.
                It is our Light, not our Darkness, that most frightens us.
                We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?
                Actually, who are you not to be?
            </p>
            <p>
                You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the World.
                There is nothing enlightening about shrinking
                so that other people won't feel unsure around you.
                We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.
                It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone.
                As we let our own Light shine,
                we consciously give other people permission to do the same.
                As we are liberated from our own fear,
                our presence automatically liberates others."
